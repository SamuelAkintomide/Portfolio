# Projects
The aim of this repository is to highlight my proficiency and expertise by compiling some of my most notable projects.
The following projects represent my own work and, in some cases, involve collaborative efforts. For detailed insights into individual contributions, please refer to the specific repository.
These projects have allowed me to delve into various aspects of robotics, web developement and data anyltics.

### Description

This is my final year project. The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of transporting items from point A to B in locations with limited human accessibility. The robot, named ARTEx (All-terrain Robotic Transportation and Exploration System), is specifically designed for deployment in the medical industry, enabling the swift delivery of medical items to critical areas. Inspired by initiatives like Zipline's operations in Rwanda, ARTEx aims to overcome the limitations of gliding drones, particularly in urban settings such as London with numerous high-rise buildings. Unlike traditional gliding drones, this system avoids dropping medical packages via parachute during flight, minimizing the risk of damage or getting stuck in inaccessible locations such as trees.

### Description

This project is the result of the final work for the exam [Robotics 2](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/rob2_en.php) SS 2021/2022, taught by Professor [Alessandro De Luca](https://www.diag.uniroma1.it/deluca/) at Sapienza University of Rome. 
Here, we delve into the modeling of elastic joint robots, a specific category that is gaining increasing popularity, with its most extreme manifestation being soft robots. Designing a PD controller for such robots is non-trivial, and in this project, we explore and demonstrate how it is feasible to regulate the position of the end effector using an iterative gravity learning compensation term. The simulations (cf. additional resources) are conducted using a 3R elastic joint robot.
