### Description

This is my final year project. The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of transporting items from point A to B in locations with limited human accessibility. The robot, named ARTEx (All-terrain Robotic Transportation and Exploration System), is specifically designed for deployment in the medical industry, enabling the swift delivery of medical items to critical areas. Inspired by initiatives like Zipline's operations in Rwanda, ARTEx aims to overcome the limitations of gliding drones, particularly in urban settings such as London with numerous high-rise buildings. Unlike traditional gliding drones, this system avoids dropping medical packages via parachute during flight, minimizing the risk of damage or getting stuck in inaccessible locations such as trees.
