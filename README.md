## 1.0 Key University Projects

### 1.1) All-Terrain Robotic Transportation and Exploration System (ARTEx)

- ***Repository:*** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/SamuelAkintomide/ARTEx)
- ***Year:*** 2024
- ***Programming Languages:*** Embedded C, HTML, JavaScript, CSS
- ***Applications:*** Fusion360, Arduino IDE, EasyEDA
- ***Microcontrollers:*** ESP32, BMP280, ADXL345, IR Sensor, L9110s
- ***Additional Resources:*** [Report](https://github.com/SamuelAkintomide/ARTEx/blob/main/Shortened%20Final%20Year%20Report.pdf)
  
#### Description

This is my final year project. The primary objective of this project is to address the challenge of transporting items from point A to B in locations with limited human accessibility. The robot, named ARTEx (All-terrain Robotic Transportation and Exploration System), is specifically designed for deployment in the medical industry, enabling the swift delivery of medical items to critical areas. Inspired by initiatives like Zipline's operations in Rwanda, ARTEx aims to overcome the limitations of gliding drones, particularly in urban settings such as London with numerous high-rise buildings. Unlike traditional gliding drones, this system avoids dropping medical packages via parachute during flight, minimising the risk of damage or getting stuck in inaccessible locations such as trees.

### 1.2) Artificial Intelligence Disease Propagation Simulation

- ***Repository:*** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/SamuelAkintomide/AIDiseaseSimulation)
- ***Year:*** 2024
- ***Programming Languages:*** C#
- ***Applications:*** Unity3D
- ***Additional Resources:*** [Report]()
  
#### Description
University project where the class was put into pairs and tasked with using AI to develop an application. I came up with the idea of using AI to simulate the spread of disease in different environments. This was inspired by the Covid-19 outbreak and would be used to simulate the potential risks in the future if another virus started spreading. The severity of the virus as well as immunity, population and vulnerability to the virus can be changed at will in the settings of the application. 

### 1.3) Java Banking Application

- ***Repository:*** [GitHub Link](https://github.com/SamuelAkintomide/JavaEEBank/tree/main)
- ***Year:*** 2024
- ***Programming Languages:*** Java
- ***Applications:*** NetBeans
- ***Additional Resources:*** [Report](), [Code]()
  
#### Description
Developed a Java-based banking application that simulates essential banking operations, including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, and transaction history tracking. The application follows object-oriented programming principles, implementing custom data structures and sorting/searching algorithms for optimised performance. It includes exception handling for secure transactions and a user-friendly interface for intuitive interactions. The system ensures data persistence through file handling or a database, maintaining user account details and transaction logs efficiently.

- ***Applications:*** Netbeans, MySQL, GlassFish Server
- ***Additional Resources:*** [Report](), [Code]()
  
#### Description
Developed a full-stack Java EE web application for chemical product browsing and purchasing, integrating a SQL database for secure data management. Implemented user authentication (signup/login), a dynamic search bar, and a shopping cart system using JSF, JavaBeans, and AJAX for smooth, interactive navigation. Designed and optimised CRUD operations for managing user data, chemical properties, and transactions. Overcame challenges such as efficient database querying for search functionality and ensuring secure password storage. The project strengthened my full-stack development skills, particularly in Java-based web development, SQL database integration, and UI/UX optimisation. Future improvements include adding a supplier management system for third-party sellers.
